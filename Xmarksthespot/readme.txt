Hey Buddy
the import kinda works in the first one(Background and Import.html) but the overall style is way better in the test page (testpage/index.html) just missing the background and the ship animation,
the index.html is how I wont it all to look but I did not get the Import to work properly.
I commented out some stuff that works but does not work together with the other stuff
Cheers
